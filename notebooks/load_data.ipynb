      "A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his sister because of increasing confusion for 10 hours. He is unable to answer questions. His sister states that he recently saw a psychiatrist for the first time because of hearing voices; he was prescribed a medication, but she is not sure what it is. She says that he has a history of excessive drinking, and she thinks that he has also experimented with illicit drugs. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 124/min, and blood pressure is 160/102 mm Hg. Examination shows profuse diaphoresis and muscle rigidity. His neck is supple. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Mental status examination shows psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy. His leukocyte count is 15,600/mm3 , and serum creatine kinase activity is 943 U/L. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?\n",
      "BASED ON THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION, THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR THIS PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS IS A DRUG-INDUCED NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME (NMS) OR A DRUG-INDUCED SEROTONIN SYNDROME (SS). GIVEN THE PATIENT'S RECENT PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION, INITIATION OF A NEW MEDICATION, AND HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE USE, BOTH POSSIBILITIES ARE RELEVANT.\n",
      "\n",
      "### KEY POINTS TO CONSIDER:\n",
      "1. **RECENT MEDICATION INITIATION**: THE PATIENT WAS RECENTLY PRESCRIBED A MEDICATION BY A PSYCHIATRIST. THIS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF INFORMATION, AS CERTAIN ANTIPSYCHOTICS (NEUROLEPTICS) CAN CAUSE NMS, AND CERTAIN ANTIDEPRESSANTS OR OTHER MEDICATIONS CAN CAUSE SS.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **SUBSTANCE USE**: THE PATIENT HAS A HISTORY OF EXCESSIVE DRINKING AND ILLICIT DRUG USE, WHICH CAN EXACERBATE THE RISK OF BOTH NMS AND SS.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **CLINICAL PRESENTATION**:\n",
      "   - **HIGH FEVER (39.1°C/102.3°F)**: A HALLMARK OF BOTH NMS AND SS.\n",
      "   - **PROFUSE DIAPHORESIS**: COMMON IN BOTH CONDITIONS.\n",
      "   - **MUSCLE RIGIDITY**: ALSO A KEY FEATURE OF BOTH NMS AND SS.\n",
      "   - **NECK SUPPLE**: THIS SUGGESTS IT IS NOT A STIFF NECK, WHICH WOULD BE MORE CONCERNING FOR A CONDITION LIKE MENINGITIS.\n",
      "   - **ABDOMEN SOFT AND NONTENDER**: THIS RULES OUT ACUTE ABDOMEN CONDITIONS.\n",
      "   - **PSYCHOMOTOR AGITATION AND LETHARGY**: THESE ARE COMMON IN BOTH NMS AND SS.\n",
      "   - **LEUKOCYTE COUNT OF 15,600/MM³**: ELEVATED, WHICH CAN OCCUR IN BOTH CONDITIONS.\n",
      "   - **SERUM CREATINE KINASE (CK) OF 943 U/L**: ELEVATED CK IS COMMON IN BOTH NMS AND SS, AS MUSCLE RIGIDITY AND AGITATION CAN LEAD TO RHABDOMYOLYSIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:\n",
      "- **NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME (NMS)**: CHARACTERIZED BY FEVER, MUSCLE RIGIDITY, ALTERED MENTAL STATUS, AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION, AND ELEVATED CK. IT IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF NEUROLEPTIC MEDICATIONS.\n",
      "- **SEROTONIN SYNDROME (SS)**: CHARACTERIZED BY FEVER, MUSCLE RIGIDITY, AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION, AND ALTERED MENTAL STATUS. IT IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF SEROTONERGIC MEDICATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN ANTIDEPRESSANTS, ILLICIT DRUGS, AND OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT INCREASE SEROTONIN LEVELS.\n",
      "\n",
      "### CONCLUSION:\n",
      "GIVEN THE RECENT INITIATION OF A NEW MEDICATION, THE PATIENT'S PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY, AND THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION, THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS **SEROTONIN SYNDROME (SS)**. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF NMS, ESPECIALLY IF THE PATIENT WAS PRESCRIBED A NEUROLEPTIC MEDICATION.\n",
      "\n",
      "### IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT:\n",
      "1. **DISCONTINUE THE SUSPECTED MEDICATION**: IF THE PATIENT WAS RECENTLY PRESCRIBED A NEW MEDICATION, DISCONTINUE IT IMMEDIATELY.\n",
      "2. **SUPPORTIVE CARE**: MANAGE FEVER, MUSCLE RIGIDITY, AND AUTONOMIC INSTABILITY WITH COOLING MEASURES, IV FLUIDS, AND BENZODIAZEPINES FOR AGITATION.\n",
      "3. **CONSULTATION**: URGENTLY CONSULT A PSYCHIATRIST AND/OR NEUROLOGIST FOR FURTHER EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT.\n",
      "\n",
      "GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE SYMPTOMS, IMMEDIATE MEDICAL INTERVENTION IS CRUCIAL.\n"
